This website was a five week project exam in the fall of 2022, during the frontend course at Noroff School of techonology and digital media. 

## Description
The assignment was to design and code a website for a blog. I was to create a headless WordPress website with blogposts and use it as an API. Then use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the website for the blog, fetch the API and display the blogposts. 

In this assignment the topic of the blog was optional. I was to find images and copy text myself. It was acceptable to use loren ipsum for the copy text in the blogposts, but the headings had to make sense. I chose skincare as the topic for my blog, because that gave me the opportunity to create a website with a relaxing and neutral design. I had not done that for the previous assignments due to the nature of their topics, and therefore wanted to do something different for this project exam.
